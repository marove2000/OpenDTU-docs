## Description

The CMT2300A module is a 868MHz RF module. It is important to get a module which supports SPI communication. Currently only the [EBYTE E49-900M20S](https://www.ebyte.com/en/pdf-down.aspx?id=2506){target=_blank} is supported as a standalone module, or use the OpenDTUFusion integrated PCB instead.

The CMT2300A uses 3-Wire half duplex SPI communication. Due to this fact it
currently requires a separate SPI bus. If you want to run the CMT2300A module
on the same ESP32 as a NRF24L01+ module or a PCD8544 display make sure you get
an ESP32 which supports 2 SPI buses (use an ESP32-S3).

Buy your hardware from a trusted source, at best from a dealer/online shop in your country where you have support and the right to return non-functional hardware. When you want to buy from Amazon, AliExpress, eBay etc., take note that there is a lot of low-quality or fake hardware offered. Read customer comments and ratings carefully!

## Pin assignment

The connection pins from the CMT2300A module to the ESP32 module can dynamically configured using [Device Profiles](../firmware/device_profiles.md) (prefered method) or at compile time.

| Name in Device Profile | Pin Function | Description | Possible name(s) on PCB |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------------- |
| sdio | Digital Input/Output | SPI Data Input/Output | SDIO |
| clk | Digital Input | SPI Clock | SCLK |
| cs | Digital Input | SPI register accesser | CSB |
| fcs | Digital Input | SPI FIFO accesser | FCSB |
| gpio2 | Digital Output | Interrupt pin | GPIO2 |
| gpio3 | Digital Output | Interrupt pin | GPIO3 |
|    | Power | Power Supply (1,8V - 3.6V) | VDD, VCC |
|    | Power | Ground | VSS, GND |
