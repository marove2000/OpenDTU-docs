# Displays

OpenDTU currently supports different types of displays (see below).
Currently only displays with a resolution of 128x64 pixel are supported. To
activate a display you have to specify its type and pin assignment in a
[device profile](../firmware/device_profiles.md).

## Display Settings

Display settings can also be found in the [Device Manager](../firmware/configuration/device_settings.md).
