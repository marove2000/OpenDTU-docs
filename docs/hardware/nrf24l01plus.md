## Description

The NRF24L01+ module is a 2,4GHz RF module. **It is absolutley important to get the newer PLUS variant!** (Only the PLUS variant supports the required transmission speeds and is able to communicate with the inverter)
There are several variants with different qualities and prices. Most of them are pin compatible. A noteable brand name is e.g. [EBYTE ML01DP5](https://www.ebyte.com/en/pdf-down.aspx?id=1136){target=_blank}. It includes a proper shielding and integrated capacitors.

Buy your hardware from a trusted source, at best from a dealer/online shop in your country where you have support and the right to return non-functional hardware.
When you want to buy from Amazon, AliExpress, eBay etc., take note that there is a lot of low-quality or fake hardware offered. Read customer comments and ratings carefully!

## Pin assignment

The connection pins from the nRF24L01+ module to the ESP32 module can dynamically configured using [Device Profiles](../firmware/device_profiles.md) (prefered method) or at compile time.
